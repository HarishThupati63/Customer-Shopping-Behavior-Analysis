This project provides a clear, recruiter-ready overview of my customer shopping behaviour analysis — covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, SQL across multiple databases, a Power BI dashboard, a detailed written report, and a presentation created with Gamma. The README explains the dataset, tools used, project steps, key insights, and instructions to run the project locally.
